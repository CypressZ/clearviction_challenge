Hiii this is my application for rendering a user list.

To start the application, run 
npm start

If there is a @mui/material related error, run
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled


Notes:
- The loading circle is not easy to spot because of short loading period, but in console you will see “displaying loading indicator” printed which would happen right before returning the loading indictor
